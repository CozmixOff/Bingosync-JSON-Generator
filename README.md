# Bingosync-JSON-Generator
An app to generate JSON file to use in BingoSync

This application was created to work with the BingoSync site and its "Custom Grid" functionality.
By downloading the .zip, you will need to equip yourself with a tool that can launch programs in python.
Two .txt files are added:
- challenges.txt lists all available challenges. You can add them manually or through the app. When adding them manually, you must separate them with a newline.
- export.txt is the JSON text to paste into the corresponding box on the BingoSync site. Do not modify anything inside, otherwise the chain will no longer work.
